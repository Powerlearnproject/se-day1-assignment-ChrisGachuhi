Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- It is the systematic process of the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
- It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline
- The advent of structured programming
- The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing support and updates to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: this approach has distinct phases. I would use this for smaller solo projects
- Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. I would use this approach on a larger scale project involving multiple developers.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing the software solution.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Responsible for the software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Responsible for planning, executing, and delivering of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, Codeblocks).
 - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software used to track changes to source code and allow coordination among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to project delays.
- Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software on schedule can result in compromised quality.
- Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
- The following strategies that can be used to sort this out would be: effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: involves testing individual components or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: tests the interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing: involves checks on the entire software system.
- Acceptance Testing: invloves checking the software against the user requirements to ensure it meets their needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions and/or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
- It's significance is to present our questions in a clear and concise manner, so that the AI understands exactly what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt: Tell me about a country called Kenya.
- Specific prompt: Tell me, when did Kenya gain its independence, describe the colonial rule she underwent and the impact it might have on her over the next 100 years.
